										<p>Medical locum spend has recently been in the spotlight with the media, hospital executives, the government and NHS bodies all weighing in. The NHS spends around £3billion a year on temporary medical and nursing staff and there are reports of locum doctors earning salaries above that of substantive staff - many think it’s all very excessive. </p>
